# Kubernetes Lab

A personal lab for experimenting with Kubernetes networking and cluster configuration, including hands-on work with Kind and custom service CIDR setups. This repo captures practical experiments and learning around cluster behavior, network configuration, and platform management.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Experiments include:
- Reconfiguring the default service CIDR in local Kind clusters
- Understanding networking behavior and pod/service connectivity
- Documenting findings and steps in a structured PDF guide
- Exploring practical platform engineering patterns for cluster setup

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

Detailed notes, diagrams, and lessons learned are included in [the PDF](Kubernetes_Default_Service_CIDR_Reconfiguration_in_Local_Kind_Cluster.pdf)
